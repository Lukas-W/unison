IMMEDIATE:

split the acquire();connect(); in Plugin::activate() - if possible
call inputPort->acquire() on PortConnect
call whatever is needed on PortDisconnect
grep for 'probably' and fix disconnect validation

watchout with acquireBuffer() on Port(Dis)Connect..
  is the reference to the old port lost?
  does this mean that the port is connected to a recycled buffer?
  do we need to hold on to a reference until postExecute?
