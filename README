 I am currently looking for developers, artists, and beta testers.

 For beta testing, I am especially interested in being able to test
 Unison on a varity of machines for performance testing.  I want to
 only improve performance ;)

 Developers are needs for plugins, platform support, support for
 3rd party stuff like file formats and other plugin technologies.

 Also, work can be started on various GUI components, tools, and
 testing.

 Artists and user interface specialists are also great!  I'd like
 ideas for themes, layout, and user workflows.  Even if you are an
 experienced user of other audio software and have a wishlist,
 please share it with me!

 Contact me if you are interested in helping out.  See AUTHORS for
 more info.
