 * ports.  This could potentially be used within Processors, but right now
 * usage should be restricted to Ports.
 *
 * Buffers cannot be copied.  Buffers are managed by a BufferProvider; this
 * allows buffers to be reused in a transparent fashion.  If copying ends up
 * being a required feature, then the Buffer *could* call a new
 * BufferProvider.clone() function to duplicate the buffer. Clients must never
 * delete a buffer, they are automatically freed by the BufferProvider through
 * the SharedBufferPtr smart pointer.
