 * of plugins.  An FxLine has exactly 2 JACK input ports and exactly 2 JACK 
 * output ports.
 *
 * This implementation currently assumes that all added plugins will have 
 * exactly 2 audio in ports and exactly 2 audio out ports.  The first plugin 
 * added will have its 2 in ports connected to the FxLine's 2 JACK in ports; 
 * likewise, the plugin's 2 out ports will be connected to the FxLine's 2 JACK 
 * out ports.  If the next plugin to be inserted were to be inserted just 
 * before the first one, then the FxLine's audio in ports will be disconnected 
 * from the first plugin, and they will be reconnected to new plugin's in 
 * ports; in addition, the new plugin's out ports will be connected to the 
 * other plugin's in ports.*/
