Immediate TODO:
===============
x TODOs
- Movement of code from main.cpp:
x   JackEngine and Callbacks
!   Connections and Compiling									<< We are here
      Ability to find Ports by name for connecting purposes
  Release To SF.net ??
  ControlPorts
  TODO-NOWs
  Documentation and add UNISON_ to #ifndefs
  Release To SF.net ??
  Jack - proper tie-in with session - allowing jack to disconnect etc..
  Mixing (multi-connect)
  Thread
  QActions
  Handle buffer-size changes
  Finish Memory Management


Random thoughts:
================

Support Lv2Plugin features
SharedBufferPtr vs BufferPtr vs BufferProvider::BufferPtr vs
  BufferProvider::Ptr


================
Port.isInput(),isOutput(),direction()  Most underlying ports have native
isInput or isOutput functions.  Using direction() forces us to if-else on the
native function then requires the consumer to switch() on the Direction. Is
this really what we want??

JackPort:

  A port backed by jack.  MANY more features than a standard port, and used
  explicitly by some parts of the program


Graph (PortGraph?):

  Some means of connecting these in the graph.



Or... Make JackEngine a "Plugin"?  or, make Plugin and JackEngine "PortHolders" (GraphNodes)
