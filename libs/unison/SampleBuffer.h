/**
 * A buffer of samples.  When a buffer of samples is replayed, it should recreate a wave.
 * A frame is a timeslice, and a sample is the value of a wave at that particular time.
 *
 * The difference between a SampleBuffer and an AudioBuffer is that the former represents
 * an "audio resource" - something that is loaded, recorded, generated.. something that
 * cannot be modified (at least for now).  AudioBuffer, on the other hand, does not
 * represent an external resource, and CAN be modified - it acts like a FIFO between 2
 * different processors.  For example, an outputPort and an inputPort communicate via a
 * shared AudioBuffer.
 *
 * SampleBuffer stores the samples in an interlaced fashion. A monaural buffer is
 * straight-forward, a stereo buffer, though, has the following layout:
 *   [LRLRLRLRLR...].  A quadraphonic layout can have a similiar layout.  We can add more
 * constants for channel-number as we support more advanced formats.  A SampleBuffer's
 * data is as long as the frame count multiplied by the number of channels.
